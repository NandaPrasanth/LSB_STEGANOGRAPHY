# LSB_STEGANOGRAPHY
🔍 **Project Overview**

Welcome to the **LSB Steganography** project! This tool allows you to hide secret messages within images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. It’s a simple yet powerful way to encode information discreetly.

🚀 **How It Works**
1. **LSB Encoding**: The message is embedded into the image by altering the least significant bits of the pixel values. These small changes are not visible to the human eye.
2. **LSB Decoding**: The message is retrieved by reading the altered bits and reconstructing the original text.

**Run the tool**:
    - **Encoding**: 
      ```bash
      ./steganography -e input_image.bmp secret_message.txt output_image.bmp
      ```
    - **Decoding**:
      ```bash
      ./steganography -d output_image.bmp
      ```

💡 **Use Cases** 
 - **Secure Communication**: Hide sensitive information in images to prevent unauthorized access.
 - **Digital Watermarking**: Embed ownership or copyright information within images.
 
🔧 **Future Enhancements**
- Support for additional image formats like PNG or JPEG.
- A graphical user interface (GUI) for easier use.
- Improved error handling and robustness.
